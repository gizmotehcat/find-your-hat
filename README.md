# Find your Hat
Find-your-hat was as interesting as it was frustrating. The idea of the game is for you to find your way from your randomly generated location, avoiding holes"o" and going out of bounds to find your hat. 

## Usage
To play game, cd path/find-your-hat and then enter 'node main.js' on your console. 

In-game instructions:
when field of play(see below) has been printed and you are prompted with "what's next?" - use 'r' for right, 'l' for left, 'u' for up and 'd' for down.
